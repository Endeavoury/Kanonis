# Design system review

## Review outcome

The system has a strong architectural base: semantic light/dark tokens, one Web Component implementation, guarded registration entry points, thin React and Angular integrations, Storybook coverage enforcement, accessibility checks, and bundle analysis. The design language is consistent and product boundaries are clearly documented.

The principal gap was component maturity beyond the P0 application shell. Several recurring product patterns were documented but still implemented in application CSS and templates. This review promotes the highest-value patterns into framework-neutral components:

- `ds-theme-toggle` for a persistent, accessible light/dark control;
- `ds-tabs` and `ds-tab` with automatic activation, roving tabindex, disabled tabs, and arrow/Home/End navigation;
- `ds-disclosure` using native details semantics;
- `ds-drop-zone` with file type/limit validation and typed accept/reject events;
- `ds-progress` for determinate and indeterminate progress;
- `ds-skeleton` with reduced-motion support.

The review also hardens existing foundations by conditionally rendering page-header metadata and trapping keyboard focus in modal detail sidebars.

A second breadth pass benchmarked the catalog against Material Design 3 and Bootstrap 5.3. It added form controls (`ds-textarea`, `ds-switch`, `ds-range`, and radio groups), native top-layer overlays, menus, tooltips, toast notifications, breadcrumbs, pagination, and flexible lists. See [Component breadth benchmark](component-parity.md) for the detailed capability matrix and deliberate exclusions.

## Quality assessment

| Area               | Assessment                                                    | Result                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Token architecture | Strong semantic roles and complete light/dark/system coverage | Keep semantic tokens as the only component color contract                                               |
| Theme behavior     | Tokens were complete; no reusable control existed             | Added `ds-theme-toggle` and application integration                                                     |
| Accessibility      | Strong native-control bias and axe coverage                   | Added keyboard tests, upload semantics, progress semantics, reduced motion, and modal focus containment |
| Component coverage | P0 complete, important P1 workflows missing                   | Added six workflow primitives plus the `ds-tab` panel element                                           |
| Framework support  | Thin adapters correctly preserve one implementation           | Added typed React wrappers and native Angular compatibility for every new element                       |
| Documentation      | Architecture and roadmap are detailed                         | Added API usage, delivery status, and this review record                                                |
| Release safety     | Good all-in-one quality gate and story coverage check         | New components participate in typecheck, lint, tests, builds, Storybook, and size analysis              |

## Remaining priorities

The catalog now contains 122 registered elements. Most remain experimental because breadth coverage
is complete before the full maturity matrix is; production promotion should follow evidence rather
than registration or Storybook presence. Prefer consolidating overlapping primitives and completing
interaction, visual, RTL, forced-colors, and product-adoption reviews before adding more surface APIs.

The general-purpose component catalog is now broad enough for full application work. The next additions should target deeper capabilities rather than more shallow wrappers:

1. autocomplete/combobox with async results and robust screen-reader announcements;
2. localized date/time input patterns;
3. segmented controls and richer data-grid behaviors;
4. automated visual regression snapshots for every theme and supported viewport;
5. formal RTL, forced-colors, and high-contrast verification.
