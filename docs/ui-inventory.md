## Responsive requirements

- Desktop: fixed/collapsible sidebar, sticky toolbar, multi-column KPI and analytics grids, dense tables.
- Tablet: full-width analytics panels, reduced column counts, horizontally scrollable comparison controls.
- Mobile: bottom navigation, two-column compact metric matrix, single-column panels, scroll containers that do not create page overflow, touch targets of at least 40–44px.
- Content stress: long localized labels, large/negative currency values, long counterparty/reference strings, empty data, and 12-month datasets.
