# Component breadth benchmark

All adapters expose the same custom-element implementation. Ontarchon Studio
and Nexus consume the vanilla custom-element contract directly from Angular;
Oikonomis does the same; the public website consumes the generated browser
bundle. React wrappers map the same properties and composed events without
forking markup or styles.

## Benchmark and scope

This catalog is benchmarked against the application-facing component families in [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/components) and [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/). The objective is comparable product-building capability, not one-to-one naming or cloning either system's visual language.

Kanonis deliberately keeps one semantic, accessible Web Component API instead of combining a CSS utility framework with a separate JavaScript plugin layer. Every component uses the same tokens, light/dark behavior, event naming, registration model, and framework adapters.

The complete package currently registers 122 custom elements. Storybook is required to contain every registered element, so the catalog cannot silently grow without a reviewable example. Presence is a discoverability check; it is not by itself evidence that every state is production-ready.

## Deliberate differences

- Carousel and scrollspy are content-site patterns, not current financial-product primitives. They remain outside the core package.
- Popovers are represented by the composable menu, tooltip, dialog, and drawer primitives. A generic unconstrained popover will only be added with a concrete accessible interaction model.
- CSS utilities are not reproduced wholesale. `ds-stack`, `ds-inline`, `ds-grid`, and `ds-container` provide stable layout contracts without leaking hundreds of global classes.
- Date/time pickers, autocomplete/combobox, and the richer data-grid layer are present, but they still
  need deeper internationalization, interaction, large-data, and accessibility evidence before being
  treated as mature solely on the strength of component parity.
- Components retain the Kanonis visual language. Material and Bootstrap are capability benchmarks, not styling dependencies.

## Catalog quality contract

New components are not considered delivered until they have:

1. semantic light and dark theme behavior;
2. keyboard and screen-reader behavior appropriate to the interaction pattern;
3. typed composed custom events;
4. full and selective registration exports;
5. React adapter coverage and native Angular compatibility;
6. Storybook examples, automated behavior tests, and representative axe coverage;
7. bundle-budget participation.

## Next maturity tier

Autocomplete/combobox, date and time inputs, and a richer data-grid layer have since been delivered.
The next tier is catalog maturity rather than breadth: a segmented control and overflow action bar
remain candidates, while token integrity, visual regression, component-level accessibility evidence,
RTL, forced-colors, high contrast, and task-pattern guidance take priority. See the
[external review](external-design-system-review.md) for the ordered backlog.
