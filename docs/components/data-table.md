# Data table and data grid

`kanonis-data-table` is the stable tabular-data primitive. `kanonis-data-grid` is its experimental enterprise
alias while editable-grid requirements are validated. Use a table when people compare structured
values across rows and columns; use a list for single-axis content and a chart for trends.

## Anatomy and content

The component contains a caption or accessible label, optional description, sticky column headers,
row-header cells, data cells, an overflow frame, optional loading veil, live status, and optional
pagination. Column labels are short nouns. A `rowHeader` column must uniquely identify each row.
Repeated actions supplied by consumers need row-specific accessible names such as “Delete Cash
account,” even when the visible label is only “Delete.” Numeric columns set `numeric` and should use
an `Intl.NumberFormat` formatter owned by the product locale.

## Sorting, identity, and pagination

Number values sort numerically, including negative amounts and decimals. Text uses natural,
case-insensitive ordering; null and undefined values stay last in either direction. Sorting does
not mutate the supplied rows. Supply raw numbers and use `format` for display-only currency formatting.

Provide a unique `rowKey` when rows can be replaced or fetched from a server. Without a key, selection
falls back to the index in the supplied `rows` array, preserved across local sorting and pagination.
The `kanonis-row-select` index refers to that source array, not the visible page. Inline buttons, links,
and form controls keep their own pointer and keyboard behavior without activating the row.

With `pageSize > 0`, the footer shows the visible row range and page controls. Pages clamp to the
available range when rows change, so filtering does not leave a blank out-of-range page. This
normalization does not emit a page request. When `totalRows > rows.length`, supply the current server
page and handle `kanonis-page-change`; the component does not slice the supplied rows. Sorts still apply
to the supplied page, so handle `kanonis-sort` to fetch globally sorted server results. Set `busy` during
requests to disable sorting, row activation, and page controls.

## State and interaction matrix

| State      | Visual and semantic behavior                               | Input                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Default    | Caption/label, headers, row headers, formatted cells       | Read and horizontal-scroll               |
| Sortable   | Header button and direction indicator; live announcement   | Click or activate header button          |
| Selectable | Hover/focus/selected cues and stable key                   | Click, Enter, or Space on a row          |
| Loading    | `aria-busy`, delayed polite “Loading” message, visual veil | Existing content remains contextual      |
| Empty      | One full-width empty message                               | Consumer provides a useful recovery cue  |
| Paged      | Previous/next controls and page status                     | Buttons emit `kanonis-page-change`            |
| Overflow   | Focus-visible scroll frame                                 | Tab, then browser horizontal-scroll keys |

## Responsive, preferences, and accessibility ownership

The table keeps tabular relationships at compact widths and gives scroll ownership to its labeled
frame. It is regression-tested at 200% page zoom, compact width, light/dark, increased contrast,
forced colors, text spacing, and RTL. Row identity, meaningful caption/description, localized
formatters, unique repeated-action names, and server request error handling remain consumer-owned.
The component owns table semantics, header scopes, sort state, focus-visible overflow, numeric
alignment, target sizes, busy/sort/page announcements, and reduced-motion styling.

Avoid disabling overflow focus when content can clip. At 400% browser zoom the same compact reflow
contract applies; do not put the table in a second horizontal scrolling container.

## Availability and evidence

- Storybook: `Components/Data Table`, including compact, empty/loading, and overflow examples.
- Behavior and accessibility: `tests/components.test.ts` and `tests/accessibility.test.ts`.
- Visual matrix: `tests/visual-regression.spec.ts`.
- Vanilla: `@endeavoury/kanonis/data-table`; React: `DataTable`; Angular: registered custom element.
- Migration: no deprecated table APIs. Treat `kanonis-data-grid` as experimental until editable-grid
  keyboard and selection models are specified.
