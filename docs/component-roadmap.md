# Component Gap Analysis and Roadmap

## Delivery status

The September 2026 cross-product design-system review completed the maturity backlog and a broader Material/Bootstrap capability pass. The system now includes 122 registered elements spanning actions, forms, navigation, overlays, feedback, data display, application structure, layout, and enterprise workflows. Every delivered element has Web Component registration, React adapters, Storybook coverage, and automated quality gates. Registration and story presence establish discoverability; readiness is assigned only when the evidence in the [component status manifest](component-status.json) satisfies the maturity policy.

## Delivery roadmap

### P0 — Current core workflows

Foundations, layouts, actions, current form controls, badges/avatar, surfaces/metrics, feedback states, data table, application shell/navigation, page header, filter bar, and KPI grid. P0 includes Storybook dashboard, monthly overview, ledger, and settings/import compositions.

### P1 — Important secondary workflows (delivered)

Tabs, disclosure, drop zone, progress/skeleton, toast, dialog/drawer, menu, pagination, breadcrumbs, and lists. Description lists remain composable from existing layout and typography primitives until a product screen requires a dedicated API.

### P2 — Generic expansion (delivered; maturity work supersedes it)

Tooltip, textarea, radio group, switch, range, breadcrumbs, autocomplete/combobox, date/time inputs,
and richer data-grid behavior are delivered. A segmented control and overflow action bar remain useful
candidates, but formal component maturity, token integrity, responsive contracts, visual regression,
RTL, forced-colors, and high-contrast validation now take priority.
